
server side:
1. get the sock5
2. compile and install(you may have to use the gcc-4 version to build, check the compiler by dpkg -l | grep gcc | awk '{print $2}', and install by apt-get install g++-4.8)
3. by default the ss5 need the daemon, it may failed due to invalid file
symbolic .., can simple type the ss5 to start the server
4. /etc/opt/ss5/ss5.conf
auth    0.0.0.0/0               -               u
permit -        0.0.0.0/0       -       0.0.0.0/0       -       -       -       -       -
5. add the passwd to ss5.passwd
user passwd
  issue: you may need the libpam0g-dev  for ubuntu

client side: use the tsocks 
1. /etc/tsocks.conf
local = 40.0.0.0/255.0.0.0

#server = nine21559.cloudapp.net
server = 40.83.126.97
server_type = 5
server_port = 1080
2. set the env pass and user
   export TSOCKS_USERNAME=user_ss5
   export TSOCKS_PASSWORD=passwd_ss5
3. start the appliction by tsocks application ...
